Deployment 

1) We have deployed our project on Google App Engine. 
2) In Google App Engine, there is a notion of Data store which the way we understand is a simple service which we can
use to do basic CRUD operations at the database layer.
3) There is an issue of  migration of local to remote data store and hence there will be very few movies available(We
have been deploying our code frequently and what we have noticed is sometimes datastore gets erased for no reason . This
can be a issue and you might not not have any movies to check ) 
4) You can check our project here : http://webvisualization.appspot.com/
5) We have mostly used Google Chrome for all our UI testing and we would strongly recommend to use this browser.
